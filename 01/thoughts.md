# Part 1
* Seems easy enough - create both lists from the input, sort them, and then do a sum of each abs(diff)
* My python skills are rusty, but that went quickly.
# Part 2
* Easy modification - don't sort, and do a multiply by count(left) to get the score
* After solving:
    * donated $25 to AoC for the year
    * created [git repo]('https://github.com/messerman/AoC2024')
    * replaced a few for loops with `sum()`, `map()`, and some `lambda` functions
