# Part 1
* Time to break out the regex - this is our first parsing-heavy question of the year.
* I got to learn a new thing - apparently you can specify in a regex a range of how many of each instance of a match to return, e.g. '\d{1,3} matches strings that contain digits from 0-999'

# Part 2
* I think I can get what I need from a single regex, but it's going to be complicated
* different samples - but the new one works for the original solution, still, I wonder if they ran into a problem with parsing and had to change the sample data
