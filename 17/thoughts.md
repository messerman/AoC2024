# Part 1
* Nice to get away from the grid-based problems for once.
* easy, straightforward, but I did run into a few bugs in my code (mostly dumb mistakes caused by trying to multitask)

# Part 2
* my initial thought is "there's no way my original solution will ever find this answer"
* my second thought is "maybe I can work backwards somehow?"
* I tried computing one character at a time, backwards, but that took too long, and I never figured out the pattern.
