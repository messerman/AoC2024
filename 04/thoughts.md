# Part 1
* ugh, have to drag out my pygrid class from last year and see if I can make it work for this
* my pygrid class is apparently not very good, I may start from scratch
* built up a new Grid class (kept my old Position class, and extended it to a GridCell)
* Grid class has a `search_from` that allows me to get n-length strings starting from any cell, and in all directions (diagonals optional)
